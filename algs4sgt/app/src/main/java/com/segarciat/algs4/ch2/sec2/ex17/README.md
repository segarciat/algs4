# Exercise 2.2.17

*Linked-list sort*. Implement a natural mergesort for linked lists. (This is the
method of choice for sorting linked lists because it uses no extra space and
is guaranteed to be linearithmic).

## Solution

TODO: On page 279, an approach is described where we use a strategy similar
to `MergeBU` to merge sublists of increasing size, first with size 1,
then size 2, then size 4, and so on. Investigate an approach like that one.
