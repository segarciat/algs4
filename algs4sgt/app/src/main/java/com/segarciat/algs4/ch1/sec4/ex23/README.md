# Exercise 1.4.23

*Binary search with duplicates*. Modify `indexOf()` (page 47) so that it
returns the index of the *first* (or *last*) entry equal to the query key.
The order of growth of your method should be $\log n$ in the worst case, even if there
are many entries in the array equal to the query key.

## Solution

This is the same as Exercise 1.4.10.
