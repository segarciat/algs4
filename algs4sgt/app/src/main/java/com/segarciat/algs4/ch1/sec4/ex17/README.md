# Exercise 1.4.17

*Farthest pair (in one dimension)*. Write a program that, given an array `a[]`
of *n* `double` values, finds a *farthest pair*: two values whose difference is
no smaller than the difference of any other pair (in absolute value). The running time
of your program should be linear in the worst case.
