# Exercise 3.1.26

*Frequency count from a dictionary*. Modify `FrequencyCounter` to take the name
of a dictionary file as its argument, count frequencies of the words from standard
input that are also in that file, and print two tables of the words with their
frequencies, one sorted by frequency, the other sorted in the order found in the
dictionary file.
