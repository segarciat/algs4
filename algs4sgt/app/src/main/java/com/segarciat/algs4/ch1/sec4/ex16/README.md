# Exercise 1.4.16

*Closest pair (in one dimension)*. Write a program that, given an array `a[]`
of *n* `double` values, finds a *closest pair*: two values whose difference
is no greater than the difference of any other pair (in absolute value). The running time
of your program should be linearithmic in the worst case.
