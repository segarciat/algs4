# Exercise 2.2.19

*Inversions*. Develop and implement a linearithmic algorithm for computing
the number of inversions in a given array (the number of exchanges that
would be performed by insertion sort for that array --- see Section 2.1).
This quantity is related to the *Kendall tau distance*; see Section 2.5.
