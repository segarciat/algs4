# Exercise 1.4.20

*Bitonic search. An array is *bitonic* if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers
followed immediately by a decreasing  sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a
bitonic array of *n* distinct <code>int</code> values, determines whether a  given integer is
in the array. Your program should use $\sim 3\lg n$ compares in the worst case.
*Extra credit*: use only $\sim 2 \lg n$ compares in the worst case.
