# Exercise 2.5.25

*Points in the plane* . Write three `static` comparators for the `Point2D` data type
of page 77, one that compares points by their `x` coordinate, one that compares them
by their `y` coordinate, and one that compares by their distance from the origin.
Write two non-`static` comparators for the `Point2D` data type, one that compares
them by their distance to a specified point and one that compares them by their
polar angle with respect to a specified point.
