# Exercise 1.4.18

*Local minimum of an array*. Write a program that, given an array `a[]`
of $n$ distinct integers, finds a \emph{strict local minimum}: an entry `a[i]`
that is strictly less than its neighbors. Each internal entry (other than `a[0]`
and `a[n-1]`) has 2 neighbors. Your program should use $\sim \lg n$ compares in
the worst case.
