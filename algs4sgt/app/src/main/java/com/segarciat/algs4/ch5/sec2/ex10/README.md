# Exercise 5.2.10

*Size*. Implement very eager `size()` (that keeps in each node the number
of keys in its subtree) for `TrieST` and `TST`.

## Solution

See `com.segarciat.algs4.ch5.sec.ex05`, my non-recursive implementations
of these classes. There, I provided a very eager implementation of `size()`.
