# Exercise 2.5.13

*Load balancing*. Write a program `LPT.java` that takes an integer `m` as a command-line
argument, reads job names and processing times from standard input, and prints a schedule
assigning the jobs to `m` processors that approximately minimizes the time when the last
job completes using the longest processing time first rule, as described on page 349.
