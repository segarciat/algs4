# Exercise 3.3.25

*Top-down 2-3-4 trees*. Develop an implementation of the basic symbol-table
API that uses balanced 2-3-4 trees as the underlying data structure, using
the red-black representation and the insertion method described in the text,
where 4-nodes are split by flipping colors on the way down the search path
and balancing on the way up.
