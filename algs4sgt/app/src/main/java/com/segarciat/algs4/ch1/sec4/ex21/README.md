# Exercise 1.4.21

*Binary search on distinct values*. Develop an implementation of binary search
for `StaticSETofInts` (see page 99) where the running time of `contains()`
is guaranteed to be $\sim \log d$, where $d$ is the number of different integers in the
array given as argument to the constructor.
