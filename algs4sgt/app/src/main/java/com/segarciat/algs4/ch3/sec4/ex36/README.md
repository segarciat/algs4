# Exercise 3.4.36

*List length range*. Write a program that inserts $n$ random `int` keys into
a hash table of size $n / 100$ using separate chaining, then finds the length
of the shortest and longest lists, for $n=10^3,10^4,10^5,10^6$.

## Solution

Here are the results for a sample run:

```text
n =    1000, longest=109
n =   10000, longest=119
n =  100000, longest=134
n = 1000000, longest=139
```
