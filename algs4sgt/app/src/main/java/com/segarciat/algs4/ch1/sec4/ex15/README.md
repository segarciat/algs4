# Exercise 1.4.15
*Faster 3-sum*. As a warmup, develop an implementation `TwoSumFaster` that
uses a *linear* algorithm to count the pairs that sum to zero after the array
is sorted (instead of the binary-search-based linearithmic algorithm). Then apply
a similar idea to develop a quadratic algorithm for the 3-sum problem.
