# Algorithms 4th Edition

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the book *Algorithms* (4th edition)
by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne [see the book website](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).

My first pass through this book was in 2020 when I purchased it to self-study data structures and
algorithms, but I did not finish Chapters 5 and 6. I decided to give it another with the following
goals in mind:

1. Refresh my knowledge on fundamental data structures and algorithms.
2. Practice Java.
3. Practice basic unit testing.
4. Prepare to self-study operating systems.

## Companion Site

The [book companion site]() has resources used throughout the book exposition and sometimes
necessary for exercises:

- `algs4.jar`: Library of static methods and data-type definitions for methods, data structures,
and other programs developed throughout the book. The library is available for
[download from the book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).
- `stdlib.jar`: Library of static methods for interacting with standard input, standard output,
file I/O, and drawing. This libraries developed for the author's alternate book,
*An Introduction to Programmin in Java: An Interdisciplinary approach*.
[Download from the book website](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
- `algs-data`: Test data files used by the authors. [Download from the book site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).
This folder is about 1.1G, so I have added to my `.gitignore`.
